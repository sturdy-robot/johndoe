# John Doe

You're **John Doe**, a retired legendary mercenary. For a stupid reason, someone has killed your cat, and you now want revenge.

They will try, but no one can stop you.

## Gameplay elements

Initially, I wanted to do some sort of topdown-shooter game. But I've been more interested in doing something resembling **Vampire Survivors**. So that's what I think I'll be doing.

This game fits the theme "Organized Chaos" because it becomes chaotic at an orderly place.

Here the game starts slow, but at every 2 minutes, the player gets a bit faster, and the enemies get faster and stronger, and the game starts to spawn more enemies.

The player collects more points with more enemies he kills. You can collect weapons that are dropped by enemies to make your weapons stronger as well.

The goal is to get the highest score you can in the highest amount of time.
