# John Doe

You're **John Doe**, a retired legendary mercenary. For a stupid reason, someone has killed your cat, and you now want revenge.

They will try, but no one can stop you.

## Gameplay elements

Initially, I wanted to do some sort of topdown-shooter game. But I've been more interested in doing something resembling **Vampire Survivors**. So that's what I think I'll be doing.

It fits the theme of having some random things going on in the game, and organizing the chaotic environment through the upgrades and collecting coins to upgrade.

In this game, the player will have the automatic weapons that you can have in **Vampire Survivors**, but you will also have special powers that you can spend energy to use. The player levels up, and the monsters can also level up.

Every ten levels, the player will get a new power. The powers have cooldowns and are limited by energy. You have to collect energy orbs that occasionally drop from enemies to restore energy. Your energy also increases after every 5 levels.
