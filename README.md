# John Doe

You're **John Doe**, a retired legendary mercenary. For a stupid reason, someone has killed your cat, and you now want revenge.

They will try, but no one can stop you.

## Gameplay elements

Initially, I wanted to do some sort of topdown-shooter game. But I've been more interested in doing something resembling **Vampire Survivors**. So that's what I think I'll be doing.

It fits the theme of having some random things going on in the game, and organizing the chaotic environment through the upgrades and collecting coins to upgrade.
